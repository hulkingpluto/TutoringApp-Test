#Smart Campus System (System A)

##Introduction
The Smart Campus System aims to revolutionize university life by integrating various aspects of campus operations into a seamless, user-friendly platform. This system will enhance the experience of students, faculty, and staff by providing efficient, accessible, and interconnected services. Each component of the system will be managed by dedicated teams, ensuring specialized focus and comprehensive development.

##Project Objective
Develop a comprehensive Smart Campus System where each component enhances a specific area of university life, integrating seamlessly through APIs to provide a cohesive service to students, faculty, and staff. Each squad is required to build one sub-system and ensure it integrates into other relevant systems. In scenarios where other dependent services are unavailable, the solutions should gracefully handle the situation and guide the user on the next steps.
